          <p class="text-lg font-sans"> I am Ems Mary Tampus, a BSIT student who dreams of becoming successful someday. My ultimate goal is to become a successful pilot, soaring through the skies and exploring the world from above.
          Apart from my passion for aviation, I am also deeply interested in web development and technology. I enjoy building websites and applications that make a positive impact on people's lives.
          In my free time, you can often find me exploring new coding techniques, reading about the latest advancements in technology, or practicing flight simulations.
          I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skillset.</p>
